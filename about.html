  <div class="mission">
    <p>Adolescence is a period of life where teenages are struggling to find an identity. Everything seems so complicated in their eyes. Their bodies are changing and they feel and experience different thing that are new to them. They need to know tat they shouldn't be ashamedabout what they feel or who they are. They also need to know that they are loved. Adults and peers seem to neglet mentally damaged invididuals or judge thembecause they don't see the "scars" as if they were physically damaged. Everyone deserves to live a happy healthy life.</p>
